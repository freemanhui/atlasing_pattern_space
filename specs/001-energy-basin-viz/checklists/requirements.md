# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Energy Basin Visualization System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## User Stories Quality

- [X] User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3, P4)
- [X] Each user story is independently testable
- [X] Each user story delivers standalone value
- [X] Priority justifications are clear
- [X] Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format
- [X] Stories build incrementally (MVP in P1)

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED

All quality criteria are met. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Properly scoped with clear boundaries
- Technology-agnostic and testable
- Ready for planning phase

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional) to ask clarifying questions
- Or proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
